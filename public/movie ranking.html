Pope's Exorcist is a horror movie with a famous name which i can not remember right now. <br>
As horror genre addicts, we have watched lots of movies and this really has a special please on us.

<h3> Lord of The Rings Serie </h3>
<p>
I have always been a geek and like most geeks, LOTR is special for me. <br>
It was always my dream to watch it with my beloved one and make her love this movie too.
I guess i became successful at the end.

Every 90s child's dream is getting a letter from Hogwarts. <br>
As children of 90s, my wife and I waited so long for the letter and even now still waiting for it by binge watching all of the movies from time to time
